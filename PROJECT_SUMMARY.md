## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Feature Engineering (`src/feature_engineering.py`)

- `calculate_total_activities()` - Count total user activities
- `calculate_unique_products_viewed()` - Count unique products per user
- `calculate_purchase_count()` - Count purchases per user
- `engineer_user_activity_features()` - Main orchestration function

**Highlights**:
- Type hints for all functions
- Comprehensive docstrings with examples
- Input validation and error handling
- Pure functions for testability

### 2. Feature Store Operations (`src/feature_store_ops.py`)

- `initialize_feature_store()` - Initialize feature store
- `define_feature_view()` - Define feature schema
- `simulate_historical_features()` - Batch retrieval for training
- `simulate_online_features()` - Real-time retrieval for serving

**Highlights**:
- Clear separation of batch and online patterns
- Simulation approach (no infrastructure required)
- Production-ready patterns and concepts

### 3. Complete Demo (`src/examples/user_activity_demo.py`)

End-to-end workflow demonstrating:
1. Raw data definition
2. Feature engineering
3. Feature store initialization
4. Feature view definition
5. Historical feature retrieval (training)
6. Online feature retrieval (serving)

**Verified**: Demo runs successfully and produces clear output

## How to Use This Project

### Running the Demo

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the demo
python src/examples/user_activity_demo.py
```

### Using the Code

```python
# Feature engineering
from src.feature_engineering import engineer_user_activity_features

raw_data = {
    'user_id': [1, 1, 2],
    'activity_type': ['view', 'purchase', 'view'],
    'timestamp': [1704067200, 1704070800, 1704074400],
    'product_id': ['A', 'A', 'B']
}

features_df = engineer_user_activity_features(raw_data)
print(features_df)
```
